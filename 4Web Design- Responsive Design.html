<p1><span style="color:red">Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO)</span> is a metabolite generated by gut microbial consumption of choline that is enriched in red meat, nuts, and fish. While choline is essential for our body to function, its derivative – TMAO – produced from the dysbiosis has been associated with the exacerbation of many inflammatory and metabolic diseases. More recently, TMAO has been linked to various neuronal diseases from mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s Disease, to autism spectrum, suggesting that microbial TMAO may be involved in regulating Gut-Brain-Axis in the host. While the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, our preliminary data suggest that the microbially derived TMAO crosses the blood-brain-barrier and induces the dysregulation of multiple neuroinflammatory and mitochondrial proteins in the mouse hippocampus. Further, we demonstrated that TMAO modifies the chromatin states in the host cells by placing post-translational modifications on histones, which can affect the folding and accessibility of DNA. In all, our data suggest that the microbially derived TMAO modulates protein homeostasis by remodeling the chromatin states in the host cells. To interrogate how TMAO remodels the chromatin biology of the host on a molecular level, we use germ-free mice and cell culture models treated with pathophysiological concentrations of TMAO and leverage multi-omics approaches and biochemical assays to examine key epigenetic changes.</p>

  <div class="two">Cell metabolism includes the many biochemical reactions that create energy and build crucial molecules for the cell.</div>
  <div class="three">Epigenetics is the study of modifications to the DNA and histone proteins, which package DNA in the nucleus. Merging these two concepts, we study how the daily workings of the cell affect the folding and accessibility of DNA, influencing how our cells and ultimately body responds to changes in diet or lifestyle. Our interdisciplinary approach spans basic biochemistry to big data, using methods ranging from in vitro enzyme assays to high-throughput mass spectrometry.</div>
